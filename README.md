# Cell Simulation Experiment

## Overview

This project is a personal experiment to simulate the evolution of simple cells in a grid-based environment. The goal is to explore how cells can evolve traits to survive and thrive, mimicking natural selection and evolutionary processes.

## Features

- **Grid-based Environment:** The simulation takes place in a grid where cells can move, eat, and avoid poison.
- **Cell Traits:** Each cell has traits such as memory capacity, speed (to be implemented), and energy efficiency, which can mutate (to be implemented) over generations.
- **Food and Poison:** The environment contains food and poison, which affect the cells' energy levels.
- **Memory System:** Cells can remember the locations of poison to avoid them in the future.
- **Reproduction (to be implemented):** Cells can reproduce if they have enough energy, passing on traits to their offspring with potential mutations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.0+
- `requirements.txt` 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cell-simulation.git
